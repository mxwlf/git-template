# Branch protection as code

The JSON files in this directory are this repository's GitHub **rulesets** —
branch protection — stored as code. Manage them from the repository root:

```sh
make rulesets-apply     # create/update the rulesets on GitHub
make rulesets-diff      # fail if GitHub no longer matches these files
make rulesets-export    # overwrite these files from GitHub (after a UI edit)
```

All three run [`scripts/github-rulesets.sh`](../../scripts/github-rulesets.sh),
which talks to `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/rulesets` via `gh api`. The `gh ruleset`
command group is read-only (`check`, `list`, `view`), so it cannot do this.

This file covers how the rules are *stored and rebuilt*. For the day-to-day
workflow they impose — how a change actually reaches `main` — see
[The workflow these rules require](../../README.md#the-workflow-these-rules-require).

## What the shipped rulesets enforce

`main-protection` is the only ruleset here, because the workflow is
**trunk-based**: `main` is the sole long-lived branch, and everything else is a
short-lived branch that exists only long enough to carry one pull request. There
is no `develop` stepping stone, so there is nothing else to protect — a feature
branch needs no rules, since it cannot reach `main` except through a reviewed,
CI-gated pull request.

| `main-protection` | |
| --- | --- |
| Enforcement | `active` |
| Direct pushes | blocked — pull request required, from any branch |
| Required check | `ci` (GitHub Actions) |
| Branch must be up to date | yes |
| Approvals | 1, admins may bypass in a PR |
| Merge methods | merge commits only (see below) |
| Signed commits | required |
| Force push / deletion | blocked |

Three consequences worth knowing before you enable this on a project:

- **Merges must happen through GitHub.** Direct pushes to `main` are blocked, and
  `required_signatures` means whatever lands there must be signed. GitHub signs
  the merge commit it creates, which satisfies the rule. A local push will be
  rejected.
- **The merge method is a merge commit, chosen to preserve authorship.** A merge
  commit adds one new object and leaves the branch's own commits untouched, so
  each keeps the signature its author made. Squash and rebase both rewrite
  history: a squash collapses the branch into one new GitHub-signed commit, and a
  rebase rewrites every commit — which *discards* the author's signature, leaving
  GitHub nothing to re-sign with. Listing `rebase` alongside
  `required_signatures` yields a merge button that always fails with *"Base
  branch requires signed commits. Rebase merges cannot be automatically signed by
  GitHub."* The cost of merge commits is that `main` is not linear; that is the
  deliberate trade for keeping author signatures in the history.
- **The admin bypass is real.** `bypass_mode: "pull_request"` lets an admin merge
  a pull request whose `ci` check is red. It prevents an accidental merge, not a
  deliberate one. Remove the `bypass_actors` entry if you want the check to be
  absolute — but on a single-maintainer repo that also makes
  `required_approving_review_count: 1` unsatisfiable, since you cannot approve
  your own pull request.

## The ruleset cannot enable a merge method the repository forbids

`allowed_merge_methods` only *narrows* what the repository already permits. The
repository has its own `allow_merge_commit` / `allow_squash_merge` /
`allow_rebase_merge` switches, they are not part of any ruleset, and this file
cannot set them. Ask for a method the repository has switched off and the merge is
refused outright:

> Merge commits are not allowed on this repository.

This repository already has merge commits enabled, so nothing is needed here — but
a repo created from this template may not. Enable it under **Settings → General →
Pull Requests**, or:

```sh
gh api --method PATCH repos/OWNER/REPO -F allow_merge_commit=true
```

This is the one part of the gate that `make rulesets-apply` cannot reproduce for
you, because it lives on the repository rather than in a ruleset. It surfaced in
`dotnet-template`, where the first merge under this policy failed on exactly that.

## The required check must actually run

A required status check that is never reported is never green, so the pull
request waits on it forever. The `context` value here (`ci`) is the **job id**
in [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../workflows/ci.yml), and that workflow's
`pull_request` trigger has to include every branch these rulesets protect. If
you rename the job, or add a protected branch, update both files together.

## What is portable between repositories

These files are meant to be copied into repos created from this template, so
they only reference ids that mean the same thing everywhere:

- **`integration_id: 15368`** in `required_status_checks` is the GitHub Actions
  app — a global app id, identical in every repository.
- **`actor_type: "RepositoryRole"`, `actor_id: 5`** is the repository admin
  role. Role ids are global too.

Do **not** commit rulesets that reference `actor_type: "Team"` or specific
users: those ids are scoped to one organization or account and will resolve to
the wrong thing, or fail, in another repo.

Ruleset **ids** are likewise per repository, which is why `apply` matches on the
`name` field instead. Rename a ruleset in one of these files and the next
`apply` creates a second one rather than renaming the original.

## Why these targets are not part of `make ci`

Rulesets are admin API surface. A workflow's default `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot read
them and cannot be granted the rights via `permissions:`, so a `rulesets-diff`
step in CI would fail for reasons that have nothing to do with the code under
test — and it would break the rule that `make ci` behaves the same on a laptop
as in a pipeline. Run these locally, or from a workflow with an admin PAT if you
want drift detection enforced.

## Editing

JSON has no comments. `scripts/github-rulesets.sh` strips any key beginning with
`_`, so a `"_comment"` key in these files is harmless — but `make rulesets-export`
regenerates them verbatim from the API and will drop it. Durable explanation
belongs in this file.

If you change protection in the GitHub UI, run `make rulesets-export` to bring
the change back into the repo; otherwise the next `make rulesets-apply` will
silently revert it.

**`apply` never deletes.** It creates and updates the rulesets named by the files
here, and ignores anything else on the repo. Removing a file therefore leaves its
ruleset live on GitHub — delete that one yourself:

```sh
id=$(gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/rulesets --jq '.[] | select(.name=="NAME") | .id')
gh api --method DELETE repos/OWNER/REPO/rulesets/$id
```

The omission is deliberate: a prune step would give a script that runs against
any repo the power to remove protection it did not create.
